Smart Contracts and Building Blocks for the Decentralized Task Management and Staking Governance Protocol (DTMP & DSGRP)
Introduction
The Decentralized Task Management Protocol (DTMP) and the Decentralized Staking, Governance, and Randomness Protocol (DSGRP) create a comprehensive ecosystem for task management, data privacy, decentralized governance, and secure data verification in blockchain applications. The use of capsules as independent nodes, cryptographic randomness, Merkle tree-based verification, and dynamic governance ensures fairness, transparency, and privacy within decentralized ecosystems.

Smart Contracts Design and Functions
1. TaskManager Contract (Core of DTMP)
The TaskManager contract is the central contract for creating, managing, and assigning tasks to capsules. It handles task definitions, deadlines, capsule assignments, and task completion tracking.

Key Functions:
createTask(string description, uint256 deadline, address[] capsules): Creates a new task with a description, deadline, and a list of capsules to perform the task.
assignTaskToCapsule(uint256 taskId, address capsule): Allows capsules to be assigned to a task after creation.
completeTask(uint256 taskId): Marks the task as complete when enough capsules report their results.
getTaskStatus(uint256 taskId): Returns the current status of the task (e.g., pending, completed).
getTaskResults(uint256 taskId): Retrieves the results from completed tasks.
solidity
Copy
contract TaskManager {
    struct Task {
        string description;
        uint256 deadline;
        address[] capsules;
        bool isComplete;
        string[] results;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Task) public tasks;
    uint256 public taskCounter;
    
    function createTask(string memory _description, uint256 _deadline, address[] memory _capsules) external {
        taskCounter++;
        tasks[taskCounter] = Task(_description, _deadline, _capsules, false, new string[](0));
    }
    
    function completeTask(uint256 _taskId) external {
        require(!tasks[_taskId].isComplete, "Task already completed.");
        tasks[_taskId].isComplete = true;
    }
    
    function addResultToTask(uint256 _taskId, string memory _result) external {
        tasks[_taskId].results.push(_result);
    }
    
    function getTaskResults(uint256 _taskId) external view returns (string[] memory) {
        return tasks[_taskId].results;
    }
}
2. Capsule Contract (For Independent Nodes in DTMP)
The Capsule contract allows capsules to autonomously perform tasks and process private data, ensuring that data is broken down, processed, and returned securely. Capsules will interact with Merkle Trees for private data handling and perform cryptographic verification.

Key Functions:
processTask(uint256 taskId, string memory data): Processes a piece of data related to a task, performs cryptographic hashing, and returns a result.
submitData(uint256 taskId, bytes32 dataHash): Submits a processed data hash to the TaskManager contract.
validateData(uint256 taskId): Ensures that the data provided by other capsules matches the required cryptographic conditions.
solidity
Copy
contract Capsule {
    address public taskManager;
    address public owner;
    
    constructor(address _taskManager) {
        taskManager = _taskManager;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function processTask(uint256 _taskId, string memory _data) public returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 dataHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_data));
        return dataHash;
    }
    
    function submitData(uint256 _taskId, bytes32 _dataHash) public {
        TaskManager(taskManager).addResultToTask(_taskId, bytes32ToString(_dataHash));
    }
    
    function bytes32ToString(bytes32 _data) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked(_data));
    }
}
3. Consensus Contract (for Task Validation)
The consensus contract ensures that tasks are completed by a sufficient number of capsules and that their results are validated. Once the consensus is reached (e.g., 3 capsules), the task is marked as complete.

Key Functions:
validateConsensus(uint256 taskId): Validates if enough capsules have contributed to the task.
isTaskComplete(uint256 taskId): Checks if the task has met the required validation criteria.
solidity
Copy
contract ConsensusManager {
    TaskManager public taskManager;
    
    constructor(address _taskManager) {
        taskManager = TaskManager(_taskManager);
    }
    
    function validateConsensus(uint256 _taskId) external view returns (bool) {
        uint256 resultCount = taskManager.getTaskResults(_taskId).length;
        return resultCount >= 3; // e.g., 3 capsules for validation
    }
    
    function isTaskComplete(uint256 _taskId) external view returns (bool) {
        return taskManager.getTaskStatus(_taskId);
    }
}
4. Staking and Governance Contract (DSGRP)
The StakingGovernance contract manages staking, governance, and rewards. It integrates with the randomness mechanism to ensure fairness.

Key Functions:
stake(uint256 amount): Allows users to stake tokens in the governance system.
withdraw(uint256 amount): Allows users to withdraw staked tokens.
commitRandomness(uint256 nonce): Users commit a nonce for the randomness phase.
revealRandomness(uint256 taskId, uint256 nonce): Reveals the random value and computes the reward based on staking and task performance.
submitProposal(string memory proposal) and voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId): Submits and votes on governance proposals.
solidity
Copy
contract StakingGovernance {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public randomnessCommitments;
    
    uint256 public totalStaked;
    
    function stake(uint256 _amount) external {
        stakes[msg.sender] += _amount;
        totalStaked += _amount;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(stakes[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient stake");
        stakes[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        totalStaked -= _amount;
    }
    
    function commitRandomness(uint256 _nonce) external {
        randomnessCommitments[msg.sender] = _nonce;
    }
    
    function revealRandomness(uint256 _taskId, uint256 _nonce) external {
        // Process and validate the revealed randomness
        uint256 reward = calculateReward(_taskId, _nonce);
    }
    
    function calculateReward(uint256 _taskId, uint256 _nonce) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // Reward logic based on staking and task accuracy
        return (_nonce % totalStaked);  // Example calculation
    }
}
5. Commit-Reveal Randomness (DSGRP)
The Commit-Reveal mechanism ensures that the randomness used in staking rewards, task validation, and governance proposals remains fair and resistant to manipulation.

Key Functions:
commitRandomness(uint256 nonce): Users commit to a random nonce.
revealRandomness(uint256 nonce): The revealed value is validated after the commitment phase.
solidity
Copy
contract Randomness {
    mapping(address => uint256) public commitments;
    
    function commitRandomness(uint256 _nonce) external {
        commitments[msg.sender] = _nonce;
    }
    
    function revealRandomness(uint256 _nonce) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 committedValue = commitments[msg.sender];
        require(committedValue == _nonce, "Invalid nonce");
        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_nonce)));
    }
}
Conclusion
This system relies on modular smart contracts to ensure decentralized task management, secure private data handling, transparent governance, and fairness in rewards. Through capsules as independent nodes, the protocol can autonomously process tasks, verify data integrity, and participate in governance, all while maintaining privacy and security.

By using commit-reveal randomness, Merkle trees, and staking rewards tied to verified data, this protocol aims to provide a highly scalable and trustworthy platform for decentralized applications, especially in fields that handle sensitive data, such as AI, DeFi, and privacy-preserving systems.
